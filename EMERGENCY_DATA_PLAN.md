# EMERGENCY DATA QUALITY PLAN

## üö® **CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE IDENTIFIED**

**Status**: Data integrity compromised - immediate intervention required
**Scope**: 100% of member-committee assignments are unreliable
**Impact**: System is providing misleading Congressional information
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Stop all data updates until resolved

---

## üìã **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 2 hours)**

### **STEP 1: SYSTEM LOCKDOWN (15 minutes)**
- [ ] **Disable automated updates** - Stop all scrapers and data imports
- [ ] **Freeze current state** - No database modifications until audit complete
- [ ] **User notification** - Add data quality warning to UI
- [ ] **Document current state** - Full database dump for forensic analysis

### **STEP 2: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (45 minutes)**
- [ ] **Database investigation** - Why are member names showing as NULL/Unknown?
- [ ] **API endpoint testing** - Test all member and committee endpoints
- [ ] **Data source audit** - Identify where corrupted data originated
- [ ] **Timeline reconstruction** - When did the corruption occur?

### **STEP 3: AUTHORITATIVE DATA SOURCING (60 minutes)**
- [ ] **Official sources identification** - Senate.gov, House.gov committee pages
- [ ] **Data collection scripts** - Build scrapers for authoritative sources
- [ ] **Validation framework** - Cross-reference multiple official sources
- [ ] **Test data creation** - Small dataset for validation

## üîß **TECHNICAL RECOVERY PLAN**

### **Database Investigation Priority**
1. **Member table integrity**: Check if member names are NULL
2. **Committee table accuracy**: Verify committee names and structures
3. **Relationship corruption**: Examine committee_memberships table
4. **API layer issues**: Test if corruption is in database or API

### **Data Replacement Strategy**
1. **Full wipe approach**: Remove all current member-committee data
2. **Authoritative rebuild**: Scrape fresh data from official sources
3. **Validation layer**: Multi-source verification for each assignment
4. **Staged deployment**: Test with small dataset before full deployment

### **Quality Assurance Framework**
1. **Known test cases**: Use your spot-check examples as validation
2. **Automated verification**: Daily checks against official sources
3. **User feedback system**: Mechanism for reporting inaccuracies
4. **Rollback capability**: Ability to revert if problems found

## üèõÔ∏è **AUTHORITATIVE DATA SOURCES**

### **Primary Sources (Official)**
1. **Senate Committee Rosters**: https://www.senate.gov/committees/
2. **House Committee Directory**: https://www.house.gov/committees
3. **Individual Committee Pages**: Each committee's official member list
4. **Congressional Leadership**: Official chair/ranking member lists

### **Validation Sources**
1. **Congress.gov**: Cross-reference for member information
2. **Biographical Directory**: Verify member details
3. **Committee Calendars**: Active participation verification
4. **Recent Hearing Records**: Member attendance patterns

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Data Accuracy Standards**
- **Member Information**: 100% accurate names, states, parties
- **Committee Assignments**: 100% accurate based on official sources
- **Leadership Roles**: 100% accurate chairs and ranking members
- **Subcommittee Data**: 95% accurate (some sources may be incomplete)

### **System Functionality**

- **Subcommittees**: Visible and accurate assignments

---

## ‚ö° **EXECUTION TIMELINE**

### **Phase 1: Emergency Response (2 hours)**
- **Immediate**: System lockdown and user notification
- **30 minutes**: Database investigation and root cause analysis
- **90 minutes**: Authoritative data collection and validation scripts

### **Phase 2: Data Reconstruction (4 hours)**
- **2 hours**: Complete database cleanup and schema validation
- **2 hours**: Fresh data import from authoritative sources

### **Phase 3: Verification & Testing (2 hours)**
- **1 hour**: Comprehensive testing with your known examples
- **1 hour**: UI testing and user experience validation

### **Phase 4: Production Deployment (1 hour)**
- **30 minutes**: Staged deployment with monitoring
- **30 minutes**: Final validation and user notification removal

---

## üö® **CRITICAL NEXT STEPS**

1. **Immediate Database Investigation**: Check why member names are NULL
2. **Official Source Scraping**: Build scrapers for Senate.gov and House.gov
3. **Test Case Validation**: Use your examples as success criteria
4. **System Lockdown**: Prevent further data corruption

**This is a complete data quality emergency requiring immediate comprehensive action.**

## üìä **AUDIT RESULTS SUMMARY**

- **Senate Judiciary**: 49 members (should be 20), all "Unknown-Unknown"
- **Commerce Committee**: Wrong committee found, 0 members
- **Member Search**: Cannot find any well-known senators
- **Data Integrity**: Complete breakdown of member information
- **System Status**: Unreliable for Congressional information

**RECOMMENDATION**: Treat current system as completely unreliable until full data reconstruction is complete.
