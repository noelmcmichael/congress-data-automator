## [5.2.1] - 2025-01-08

### fix: House Committee Filtering 500 Error
- **Critical Fix**: Resolved 500 Internal Server Error when filtering committees by `chamber=House`
- **Root Cause**: SQLAlchemy ORM query issue with committee relationships
- **Solution**: Replaced ORM query with raw SQL query for committees endpoint
- **Impact**: House committee filtering now works correctly (5 committees returned)

### Technical Details
- Modified `/api/v1/committees` endpoint to use raw SQL instead of ORM
- Fixed case-sensitive chamber filtering (House, Senate, Joint)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API parameters
- Improved response time consistency across all chamber filters

### Testing Results
- House chamber filtering: ✅ 200 status (was 500 error)
- Senate chamber filtering: ✅ 200 status (unchanged)
- Joint chamber filtering: ✅ 200 status (unchanged)
- Case sensitivity: ✅ `chamber=house` returns 0 items (correct behavior)
- Performance: ✅ Response time <150ms for all chamber filters

### Deployment
- Container: `gcr.io/chefgavin/congress-api:chamber-fix-v1`
- Service: `congressional-data-api-v3`
- Environment: Production (us-central1)
- Status: ✅ Deployed and verified
