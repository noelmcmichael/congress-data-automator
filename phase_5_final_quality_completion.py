Phase 5: Final Quality Completion
=================================

Complete the remaining 5% of data quality issues to achieve 100% production readiness:
1. Resolve leadership conflicts (multiple chairs/ranking members)
2. Assign remaining 122 members to appropriate committees
3. Populate empty subcommittees
4. Final system validation
