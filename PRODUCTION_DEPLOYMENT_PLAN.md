### **Performance Targets**
- **Response Time**: < 100ms (95th percentile)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Throughput**: 1000+ requests/minute
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1%
- **Database Connections**: Pooled (10-20 connections)

### **Security Requirements**
- HTTPS only (SSL/TLS termination)
- CORS policy configuration
- Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per IP)
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- Environment variable security

### **Monitoring Metrics**
- API response times and error rates
- Database connection pool utilization
- Memory and CPU usage
- Request volume and patterns
- Health check status

## 📊 **Success Criteria**

### **Functional Requirements**
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly (100% success rate)
- [ ] Database connections are stable and performant
- [ ] Error handling works in production environment
- [ ] Search and statistics endpoints function correctly
- [ ] Health checks pass consistently

### **Performance Requirements**
- [ ] API response time < 100ms for 95% of requests
- [ ] Database query time < 50ms average
- [ ] System handles 100+ concurrent users
