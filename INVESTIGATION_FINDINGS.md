# Congressional Data Platform - Investigation Findings

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS COMPLETE

### **PRIMARY ISSUE: Member ID Mismatch**

**Problem**: The relationship data exists for member IDs 1-20, but the current member list contains different IDs (19, 24, 62, etc.).

**Impact**: Users clicking on members from the list navigate to member IDs that don't have relationship data.

**Evidence**:
- Member ID 1: 2 committee memberships (relationship data exists)
- Member ID 19: 2 committee memberships (relationship data exists)
- Member ID 24: 0 committee memberships (no relationship data)
- Current member list: 50 members with IDs [19, 24, 62, 63, 73, 95, ...]

### **SECONDARY ISSUE: Congress API Access**

**Problem**: Congress.gov API returning 403 Forbidden errors.

**Root Cause**: No Congress API key found in secrets management.

**Error**: `Client error '403 Forbidden' for url 'https://api.congress.gov/v3/member?limit=250&chamber=house&currentMember=true'`

**Impact**: Cannot collect new data or refresh existing data.

## üìä CURRENT DATA STATUS

### **What's Working**
- ‚úÖ API health: Healthy
- ‚úÖ Database connection: Active
- ‚úÖ Relationship endpoints: Functional
- ‚úÖ Relationship data: Exists for specific member IDs
- ‚úÖ Frontend components: Deployed and working

### **What's Not Working**
- ‚ùå Relationship data visibility: Only shows for specific member IDs
- ‚ùå Congress API access: 403 Forbidden errors
- ‚ùå Data collection: Cannot gather new data
- ‚ùå Member ID consistency: Mismatch between list and detail data

## üéØ RESOLUTION PLAN

### **Option 1: Fix Member ID Mapping (Quick Fix)**
1. **Create relationship data for current member IDs**
   - Use the populate test relationships endpoint
   - Map relationships to current member IDs (19, 24, 62, etc.)
   - Test relationship visibility in UI

### **Option 2: Full Data Expansion (Comprehensive Fix)**
1. **Get new Congress API key**
   - Obtain dedicated API key for this project
   - Store in secrets management
   - Test Congress API connectivity

2. **Collect full Congressional data**
   - Populate all 535 members of Congress
   - Collect real committee membership data
   - Expand relationships to full dataset

3. **Implement real relationship data**
   - Replace test data with actual Congress.gov data
   - Ensure all members have proper committee memberships
   - Verify relationship data quality

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
1. **Immediate fix**: Create relationship data for current member IDs
2. **Long-term solution**: Implement full data expansion with new API key

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Quick Fix Steps**
1. Identify which current member IDs need relationship data
2. Use `/api/v1/populate/test-relationships` endpoint
3. Create relationships for members 19, 24, 62, 63, 73, 95, etc.
4. Test UI relationship visibility

### **Full Fix Steps**
1. Obtain new Congress API key
2. Store in secrets: `CONGRESS_API_KEY`
3. Update backend to use new key
4. Run full data collection
5. Verify all members have committee memberships

## üìã RECOMMENDATION

**Start with Option 1 (Quick Fix)** to immediately resolve the UI issue, then proceed with Option 2 (Full Data Expansion) for the complete solution.

**Benefits**:
- Users can immediately see relationships working
- Provides foundation for full data expansion
- Demonstrates system functionality
- Low risk, high impact

**Next Steps**:
1. Create relationship data for current member IDs
2. Test relationship visibility in UI
3. Obtain new Congress API key
4. Plan full data expansion
