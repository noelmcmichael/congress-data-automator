## 🚀 **STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION**

### **OPTION 1: MANUAL SQL EXECUTION (RECOMMENDED)**

#### **Step 1: Apply Database Migration (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Connect to production database and execute:
psql -h [DATABASE_HOST] -U postgres -d congress_data -f data_quality_migration.sql
```

#### **Step 2: Restart API Service (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Restart Cloud Run service to pick up changes
gcloud run services update congressional-data-api-v2 --region us-central1
```

#### **Step 3: Verify Deployment (10 minutes)**
```bash
python3 verify_deployment.py
```

### **OPTION 2: AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT (IF CLOUD SQL ACCESS AVAILABLE)**
```bash
./deploy_data_quality.sh
python3 verify_deployment.py
```

## 🔍 **DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION**

### **Pre-Deployment Checks** ✅
- [x] API health verified (healthy)
- [x] Current hearing coverage confirmed (0.0%)
- [x] SQL scripts validated (97 updates ready)
- [x] Target hearings exist in database
- [x] Target committees exist in database

### **Post-Deployment Verification**
- [ ] Hearing committee coverage >= 48.5%
- [ ] Specific hearing 120 assigned to committee 134
- [ ] API endpoints return hearing committee data
- [ ] No performance degradation

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Functional Requirements**
- ✅ All SQL scripts execute without errors
- ✅ Hearing committee coverage improves from 0% to 48.5%
- ✅ API endpoints return hearing committee relationships
- ✅ No performance degradation in API response times

### **Data Quality Requirements**
- ✅ 97 hearings correctly assigned to appropriate committees
- ✅ Committee assignments match pattern-based matching confidence scores
- ✅ All relationships maintain referential integrity
- ✅ Audit trail created for all changes

---

## 🚨 **RISK MITIGATION**

### **Low Risk Factors**
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All 97 updates validated against production
- **Backup Procedures**: SQL migration includes transaction rollback capability
- **Audit Logging**: All changes tracked in data_quality_audit table
- **Validation Scripts**: Automated verification of deployment success

### **Rollback Plan**
```sql
-- If needed, rollback hearing committee assignments
BEGIN;
UPDATE hearings SET committee_id = NULL WHERE committee_id IS NOT NULL;
DELETE FROM data_quality_audit WHERE operation_type = 'migration';
COMMIT;
```
