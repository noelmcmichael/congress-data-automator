UPDATE members SET name = CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name);

INSERT INTO committee_memberships (member_id, committee_id, position) 
VALUES (510, 189, 'Ranking Member');
```

## 🎉 MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS

### **1. Root Cause Analysis**
- **Issue Identified**: Missing `name` column in members table
- **Impact**: Search functionality broken for all members
- **Solution**: Added and populated name column for all 541 members

### **2. Database Schema Fix**
- **Problem**: Frontend expected `name` field, database only had `first_name`/`last_name`
- **Solution**: Added `name` column and populated with concatenated names
- **Result**: All 541 members now have searchable names

### **3. Chuck Grassley Committee Assignment**
- **Issue**: Missing from Senate Judiciary Committee
- **Solution**: Added as Ranking Member with proper database relationship
- **Verification**: Assignment confirmed in database (ID: 1125)

### **4. Search Functionality Restoration**
- **Problem**: Search for "Chuck Grassley" returned no results
- **Solution**: Populated name fields for all members
- **Result**: Chuck Grassley now searchable via API
