- **Impact**: Cannot execute SQL directly from current environment
- **Status**: Blocking production deployment execution

### Root Cause
- **Library Conflict**: Multiple OpenSSL/crypto library versions causing psycopg2/psql conflicts
- **Environment**: Local development environment library mismatches
- **Solution**: Requires clean PostgreSQL client environment or alternative execution method
