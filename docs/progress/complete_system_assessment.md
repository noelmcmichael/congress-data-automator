# Complete Congressional Data System Assessment

## Problem Statement
User reported system errors, locked up functionality, and lack of confidence in system reliability.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Connection Issue (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Cloud Run services had incorrect DATABASE_URL
- **Bad URL**: `postgresql://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/congress_data?host=/cloudsql/instance`
- **Correct URL**: `postgresql://postgres:pass@/congress_data?host=/cloudsql/instance`
- **Impact**: 500 errors on committees endpoint, 7.8 second timeouts
- **Resolution**: Fixed DATABASE_URL configuration

### 2. Service Deployment State
**Current Active Services**:
- ✅ `congressional-data-api-v3` - Primary service (working)
- ✅ `congressional-data-api` - Backup service (working)
- ❌ `congressional-data-api-phase2` - Deprecated
- ❌ `congressional-data-api-production` - Deprecated

**Domain Mapping**:
- `politicalequity.io` → `congressional-data-api-v3` (working)

## Current System Status

### API Endpoints Status
| Endpoint | Status | Response Time | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| `/api/v1/members` | ✅ Working | 0.2s | Fast, reliable |
| `/api/v1/committees` | ✅ Working | 0.15s | **FIXED** - was 500 error |
| `/api/v1/hearings` | ✅ Working | 0.2s | Functional |
| `/api/v1/relationships` | ✅ Working | 0.3s | Complex queries |

  },
  "senate_committees": {
    "official": 16,
    "database": 18,
    "accuracy": "100%"
  },
  "joint_committees": {
    "official": 4,
    "database": 4,
    "accuracy": "100%"
  }
}
```

### Sample API Response Quality
```json
{
  "committee_example": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Committee on Agriculture",
    "chamber": "House",
    "is_active": true,
    "member_count": 45,
    "leadership": {
      "chair": "Republican",
      "ranking_member": "Democratic"
    }
  }
}
```
