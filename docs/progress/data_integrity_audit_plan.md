# Data Integrity Audit & Remediation Plan
## Congressional Data System - 119th Congress

### Objective
Conduct comprehensive data integrity audit and remediation to ensure complete and accurate congressional data, particularly committee-to-member relationships, addressing fundamental data quality concerns.

### Current State Analysis
- **System Claims**: 99.1% health, 541 members, 43 committees
- **User Concern**: "Important committees seemed to have vanished" - committee-member relationships not trustworthy
- **Data Quality**: Standing committees present but relationships may be incomplete or incorrect

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Data Completeness**: 100% of official 119th Congress members and committees captured
2. **Relationship Accuracy**: All committee-member relationships verified against official sources
3. **Data Consistency**: Committee names, jurisdictions, and hierarchies match official records
4. **System Confidence**: User confidence in data accuracy restored to 100%
5. **Performance**: All queries maintain <200ms response time

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Data Audit & Gap Analysis (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Identify missing/incorrect data through systematic comparison

**Tasks**:
- Compare current 43 committees vs official Senate/House committee lists
- Audit committee-member relationships against official assignments
- Check for missing standing committees, subcommittees, and joint committees
- Identify any duplicate or incorrect committee names

**Deliverables**:
- Complete gap analysis report
- Missing committee list
- Incorrect relationship inventory

#### Phase 2: Authoritative Data Collection (45 minutes)
**Objective**: Collect verified data from official Congressional sources

**Tasks**:
- Scrape official Senate committee assignments (senate.gov)
- Collect House committee assignments (house.gov)
- Gather joint committee information
- Verify special committee and select committee data

**Deliverables**:
- Authoritative 119th Congress dataset
- Committee-member relationship mappings
- Data validation reports

#### Phase 3: Database Remediation (60 minutes)
**Objective**: Fix database structure and populate with accurate data

**Tasks**:
- Update committee table with missing/corrected entries
- Rebuild committee-member relationships from scratch
- Implement data validation constraints
- Create backup of current state before changes

**Deliverables**:
- Updated database schema
- Complete relationship mappings
- Data integrity constraints

#### Phase 4: Verification & Testing (30 minutes)
**Objective**: Validate system accuracy and performance

**Tasks**:
- Test all API endpoints with corrected data
- Verify committee-member relationships
- Run performance benchmarks
- Conduct user acceptance testing

**Deliverables**:
- Verification test results
- Performance metrics
- User confidence assessment

### Risk Assessment

#### High Risk
- **Data Loss**: Current incorrect data could be lost during remediation
- **Mitigation**: Full database backup before any changes

#### Medium Risk
- **API Downtime**: Service interruption during database updates
- **Mitigation**: Use atomic transactions and rolling updates

#### Low Risk
- **Performance Degradation**: Increased data volume affecting response times
- **Mitigation**: Database indexing and query optimization

### Test Hooks
- **Unit Tests**: Committee-member relationship queries
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint accuracy verification
- **Performance Tests**: Response time benchmarks
- **User Acceptance Tests**: Real-world query scenarios

### Success Metrics
- **Data Completeness**: 100% official committees and members captured
- **Relationship Accuracy**: 100% verified committee-member mappings
- **User Confidence**: Restored trust in system data quality
- **Performance**: <200ms response time maintained
- **System Health**: 99.5%+ overall system confidence

### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 30 minutes - Data audit complete
- **Phase 2**: 45 minutes - Authoritative data collected
- **Phase 3**: 60 minutes - Database remediation complete
- **Phase 4**: 30 minutes - Verification and testing complete
- **Total**: 2 hours 45 minutes

### Quality Gates
Each phase requires sign-off before proceeding:
1. **Phase 1**: Gap analysis approved, missing data identified
2. **Phase 2**: Authoritative data validated, sources verified
3. **Phase 3**: Database backup confirmed, remediation tested
4. **Phase 4**: All tests passing, user acceptance confirmed

### Rollback Plan
- **Database Backup**: Complete snapshot before Phase 3
- **Rollback Trigger**: Any data integrity failures or performance degradation
- **Recovery Time**: <15 minutes to restore previous state
- **Validation**: Immediate post-rollback testing
