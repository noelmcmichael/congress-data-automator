# Strategic Overhaul Analysis - Committee-Centric Approach

## üéØ Problem Definition

### Current State Analysis
- **Members**: 541 (quantity correct)
- **Committees**: 43 (structure exists) 
- **Member Assignments**: ‚ùå **INACCURATE** (quality failure)
- **User Experience**: Still seeing wrong committee compositions

### Core Issue Identified
**Quality vs Quantity**: Having complete member lists doesn't ensure accurate committee assignments. The fundamental problem is **assignment accuracy**, not member count.

### User Insight: Strategic Pivot Required
- **From**: Automated completeness across all committees
- **To**: Curated accuracy for priority committees
- **Focus**: 6 key Senate committees with editorial validation
- **Value**: Higher accuracy, faster utility, manageable scope

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Committee authority and editorial control
CREATE TABLE committee_editors (
    committee_id INT,
    editor_user_id INT,
    authority_level VARCHAR(20), -- 'primary', 'secondary', 'reviewer'
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Member assignment authority tracking
CREATE TABLE member_assignments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    member_id INT,
    committee_id INT,
    assignment_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'chair', 'ranking', 'member'
    authority_source VARCHAR(50), -- 'editorial', 'official', 'scraped'
    confidence_score INT, -- 1-100
    verified_by INT, -- user_id of editor
    verified_at TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(20), -- 'draft', 'review', 'published'
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Change history and audit trail
CREATE TABLE assignment_changes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    assignment_id INT,
    change_type VARCHAR(20), -- 'add', 'remove', 'update'
    old_value JSONB,
    new_value JSONB,
    changed_by INT,
    reason TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Design Changes
```python
# Committee-centric endpoints
GET /api/v1/committees/{committee_id}/members
POST /api/v1/committees/{committee_id}/members
PUT /api/v1/committees/{committee_id}/members/{member_id}
DELETE /api/v1/committees/{committee_id}/members/{member_id}

# Editorial workflow endpoints
GET /api/v1/committees/{committee_id}/pending-changes
POST /api/v1/committees/{committee_id}/review
PUT /api/v1/committees/{committee_id}/publish
GET /api/v1/committees/{committee_id}/history

# Authority and validation endpoints
GET /api/v1/committees/{committee_id}/authority
POST /api/v1/committees/{committee_id}/verify
GET /api/v1/committees/{committee_id}/quality-score
```

### Editorial Interface Design
```javascript
// Committee Editor Dashboard
interface CommitteeEditor {
  committee: Committee;
  members: Member[];
  pendingChanges: Change[];
  authorityLevel: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'reviewer';
  
  // Actions
  addMember(member: Member): void;
  removeMember(memberId: string): void;
  updateMember(memberId: string, changes: Partial<Member>): void;
  reviewChanges(): void;
  publishChanges(): void;
  revertChanges(): void;
}
```
