## üìã **PHASE 1: SENATE COMMITTEE SCRAPING** *(STARTING NOW)*

### **Step 1.1: Senate Committee Discovery**

- [ ] Test scraping approach on single committee first

### **Step 1.2: Member Name Matching**
- [ ] Extract member names from committee rosters
- [ ] Match against existing database records (by name + state)
- [ ] Handle edge cases (nicknames, middle names, etc.)

### **Step 1.3: Database Population**
- [ ] Create member-committee relationship records
- [ ] Update API response to include committee data
- [ ] Validate relationship queries work

### **Expected Senate Results**
- **Committees**: ~20 major Senate committees
- **Memberships**: ~100 senator-committee relationships
- **Senators**: ~50 senators with committee assignments
