### PHASE 6: Deployment & Monitoring
11. **Deploy Updated API**
    - Build new container with 119th data
    - Deploy to Google Cloud Run
    - Test production endpoints
    - Verify UI displays correct information

12. **Establish Monitoring System**
    - Set up alerts for Congress transitions
    - Create automated validation checks
    - Document update procedures for future Congress

## üîÑ AUTOMATED CONGRESS DETECTION SYSTEM

### Key Features
- **Current Session Detection**: Automatically identify active Congress
- **Transition Alerts**: Flag when new Congress convenes
- **Data Staleness Warnings**: Alert when data is from previous Congress
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintain record of all Congressional sessions

### Implementation
```python
def get_current_congress():
    """Calculate current Congress number based on date"""
    # 119th Congress: Jan 3, 2025 - Jan 3, 2027
    # Each Congress is 2 years, starting on odd years
    
def is_data_current():
    """Check if database contains current Congress data"""
    
def flag_outdated_data():
    """Alert system when data needs updating"""
```

## üìä EXPECTED CHANGES (118th ‚Üí 119th)

### Leadership Changes Expected
- **Committee Chairs**: Likely changes due to election results
- **Ranking Members**: Potential shifts based on party control
- **New Members**: Freshman legislators with new assignments
- **Retirements**: Committee spots opened by departing members

### Structural Changes Expected
- **Committee Reorganization**: Possible committee mergers/splits
- **Subcommittee Changes**: New subcommittees or disbanded ones
- **Jurisdiction Updates**: Modified committee responsibilities

## üö® CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Data Currency**: Must use 119th Congress sources only
2. **Source Verification**: Confirm official pages are updated
3. **Complete Coverage**: All committees, all members, all leadership
4. **Future-Proofing**: System must handle 121st Congress transition
5. **Historical Preservation**: Maintain 118th data for reference
