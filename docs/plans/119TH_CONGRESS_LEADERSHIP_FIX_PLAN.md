# 119th Congress Leadership Fix & Senate Expansion Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ MISSION: DATABASE ACCURACY & REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP UPDATE

### **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**
- **Database State**: Contains 118th Congress leadership positions (outdated)
- **Current Reality**: 119th Congress (2025-2027) with Republican unified control
- **Example**: Senate Judiciary Committee shows Durbin (D) as Chair, Grassley (R) as Ranking Member
- **Correct 119th**: Grassley (R) should be Chair, Democrat should be Ranking Member

### **EXPERT KNOWLEDGE: 119TH CONGRESS CHANGES**
- **Senate Control**: Republicans gained majority (51-49 split)
- **House Control**: Republicans maintained majority  
- **Committee Leadership**: All committee chairs are now Republican
- **Major Changes**: Leadership flipped on all Senate committees from Democratic to Republican chairs
