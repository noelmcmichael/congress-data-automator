# Web Scraping Enhancement Plan
## Congressional Data Platform - Real-time Committee Assignment Updates

### **PROJECT OVERVIEW**
Transform the Congressional Data Platform from static committee assignments to real-time, authoritative data sourcing with confidence scoring and validation mechanisms.

### **IDENTIFIED ISSUE**
- **Example**: Chuck Grassley not listed as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman despite being the actual chairperson
- **Root Cause**: Committee assignments may be outdated or incomplete for 119th Congress
- **Impact**: Undermines platform credibility and user trust

### **OBJECTIVES**
1. **Real-time Updates**: Scrape authoritative sources for current committee assignments
2. **Data Validation**: Multiple source verification for accuracy confidence
3. **Quality Measurement**: Quantifiable confidence scoring system
4. **Automated Monitoring**: Detect and alert on assignment changes
5. **Organized Approach**: Simple, maintainable scraping architecture

## **STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Authority Source Research & Assessment (30 minutes)**
**Goal**: Identify the most reliable, scrapable sources for committee assignments

#### **Step 1.1: Primary Authority Sources**
- **congress.gov**: Official US Government congressional database
- **house.gov/committees**: House official committee pages
- **senate.gov/committees**: Senate official committee pages
- **clerk.house.gov**: House Clerk committee rosters
- **senate.gov/general/committee_assignments**: Senate committee assignments

#### **Step 1.2: Secondary Validation Sources**
- **govtrack.us**: Reliable congressional data aggregator
- **ballotpedia.org**: Comprehensive political reference
- **opensecrets.org**: Campaign finance with committee data
- **congress.gov/committees**: Federal committee listings

#### **Step 1.3: Scrapability Assessment**
- **Test each source**: Check for anti-scraping measures
- **Response time analysis**: Measure load times and reliability
- **Data structure evaluation**: HTML parsing complexity
- **Update frequency**: How often sources are updated

### **Phase 2: Data Validation Framework (45 minutes)**
**Goal**: Create multi-source validation system with confidence scoring

#### **Step 2.1: Confidence Scoring System**
```python
# Confidence Score Calculation
def calculate_confidence(source_count, authority_weight, freshness_score):
    """
    Returns confidence score 0-100%
    - source_count: Number of sources confirming assignment
    - authority_weight: Weight of authoritative sources (govt vs third-party)
    - freshness_score: How recently the data was updated
    """
    base_score = min(source_count * 25, 75)  # Max 75% from multiple sources
    authority_bonus = authority_weight * 20   # Max 20% from authority
    freshness_bonus = freshness_score * 5    # Max 5% from freshness
    return min(base_score + authority_bonus + freshness_bonus, 100)
```

#### **Step 2.2: Validation Rules**
- **Minimum 2 sources**: Required for any assignment
- **Government source priority**: .gov domains weighted higher
- **Chairman/Ranking Member**: Requires 3+ sources for leadership positions
- **Conflict resolution**: Majority rule with manual review flagging

#### **Step 2.3: Database Enhancement**
```sql
-- Add confidence tracking to relationships table
ALTER TABLE committee_memberships 
ADD COLUMN confidence_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN last_verified TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN source_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN verification_sources TEXT[];
```

### **Phase 3: Web Scraping Implementation (60 minutes)**
**Goal**: Build robust, organized scraping tools for each source

#### **Step 3.1: Scraper Architecture**
```python
class CongressionalScraper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sources = {
            'congress_gov': CongressGovScraper(),
            'house_gov': HouseGovScraper(),
            'senate_gov': SenateGovScraper(),
            'govtrack': GovTrackScraper(),
            'ballotpedia': BallotpediaScraper()
        }
        
    def scrape_all_sources(self, committee_id):
        """Scrape all sources for a committee"""
        results = {}
        for source_name, scraper in self.sources.items():
            try:
                results[source_name] = scraper.get_committee_members(committee_id)
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"Scraping failed for {source_name}: {e}")
        return results
```

#### **Step 3.2: Source-Specific Scrapers**
- **CongressGovScraper**: Parse official committee pages
- **HouseGovScraper**: Extract House committee rosters
- **SenateGovScraper**: Parse Senate committee assignments
- **GovTrackScraper**: API-based member-committee relationships
- **BallotpediaScraper**: Backup validation source

#### **Step 3.3: Error Handling & Resilience**
- **Retry logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Rate limiting**: Respect robots.txt and reasonable delays
- **User agent rotation**: Avoid being blocked
- **Cache responses**: Reduce redundant requests

### **Phase 4: Data Quality Improvement (45 minutes)**
**Goal**: Implement systematic data quality enhancement

#### **Step 4.1: Quality Metrics**
- **Completeness**: % of members with committee assignments
- **Accuracy**: % of assignments verified by multiple sources
- **Freshness**: Average age of committee assignment data
- **Consistency**: Agreement rate between sources
- **Coverage**: % of committees with full member lists

#### **Step 4.2: Quality Dashboard**
```python
class QualityDashboard:
    def generate_quality_report(self):
        return {
            'total_assignments': self.count_assignments(),
            'verified_assignments': self.count_verified(),
            'confidence_distribution': self.confidence_histogram(),
            'source_reliability': self.source_accuracy_rates(),
            'stale_data_alerts': self.find_stale_assignments(),
            'conflict_reports': self.identify_source_conflicts()
        }
```

#### **Step 4.3: Automated Quality Checks**
- **Daily verification**: Re-scrape 10% of assignments randomly
- **Leadership monitoring**: Weekly check of all chair/ranking member positions
- **Conflict detection**: Alert when sources disagree
- **Staleness alerts**: Flag assignments >30 days old

### **Phase 5: Chuck Grassley Specific Validation (15 minutes)**
**Goal**: Immediately fix the identified issue and validate correction

#### **Step 5.1: Grassley Validation**
- **Verify current position**: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
- **Multi-source check**: Confirm across all available sources
- **Update database**: Correct assignment with high confidence score
- **Document correction**: Log the fix with source references

#### **Step 5.2: Similar Issues Detection**
- **Scan for similar gaps**: Other missing leadership positions
- **Cross-reference leadership**: Verify all committee chairs and ranking members
- **Priority corrections**: Fix any critical missing assignments

### **Phase 6: Production Deployment (30 minutes)**
**Goal**: Deploy enhanced scraping system to production

#### **Step 6.1: API Enhancements**
- **Confidence endpoints**: Add confidence scores to API responses
- **Validation status**: Show last verification date for assignments
- **Quality metrics**: Expose data quality dashboard via API
- **Manual verification**: Admin endpoints for manual corrections

#### **Step 6.2: Frontend Integration**
- **Confidence indicators**: Show confidence scores in UI
- **Last verified**: Display when assignments were last checked
- **Source attribution**: Show which sources confirmed assignments
- **Quality dashboard**: Admin interface for data quality monitoring
