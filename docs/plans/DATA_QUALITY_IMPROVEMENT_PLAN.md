# Congressional Data Quality Improvement Plan

## 🎯 **Objective**
Fix committee membership mappings and hearing-committee relationships in our production Congressional Data API to ensure accurate data representation.

## 📊 **Current Issues Identified** *(Confirmed by Audit)*
1. **Committee Membership Mappings**: **0% of members have committee assignments** ❌ CRITICAL
2. **Hearing-Committee Relationships**: **0% of hearings are mapped to committees** ❌ CRITICAL  
3. **Data Integrity**: Complete absence of relationship data - database has entities but no relationships
4. **Audit Results**: 100 members, 100 committees, 100 hearings - all unlinked

## 🔍 **Phase 1: Data Audit & Analysis**

### **Step 1.1: Current State Assessment**
- [ ] Audit existing database relationships
- [ ] Identify scope of incorrect committee memberships
- [ ] Analyze hearing-committee mapping gaps
- [ ] Document current data quality baseline

### **Step 1.2: Data Quality Metrics**
- [ ] Count total members with committee assignments
- [ ] Count hearings with proper committee links
- [ ] Identify orphaned records and missing relationships
- [ ] Create data quality scorecard

## 🏛️ **Phase 2: Authoritative Data Source Identification**

### **Step 2.1: Primary Sources Research**
- [ ] **Congress.gov API**: Official congressional data
- [ ] **House.gov Committee Pages**: Current House committee rosters
- [ ] **Senate.gov Committee Pages**: Current Senate committee rosters
- [ ] **GovInfo.gov**: Hearing transcripts and metadata

### **Step 2.2: Data Source Validation**
- [ ] Test access to each data source
- [ ] Validate data format and completeness
- [ ] Identify rate limits and access requirements
- [ ] Create data collection strategy

## 🔧 **Phase 3: Data Collection & Validation Framework**

### **Step 3.1: Committee Membership Collection**
- [ ] Create web scraper for House committee rosters
- [ ] Create web scraper for Senate committee rosters  
- [ ] Implement Congress.gov API integration for official data
- [ ] Cross-validate data from multiple sources

### **Step 3.2: Hearing-Committee Relationship Collection**
- [ ] Extract committee information from hearing metadata
- [ ] Map hearing URLs to committee jurisdictions
- [ ] Validate hearing dates with committee schedules
- [ ] Create hearing-committee linkage rules

## 📝 **Phase 4: Data Correction Implementation**

### **Step 4.1: Database Schema Validation**
- [ ] Verify current relationship table structures
- [ ] Ensure foreign key constraints are properly defined
- [ ] Check for missing indexes on relationship fields
- [ ] Backup current database state

### **Step 4.2: Committee Membership Corrections**
- [ ] Create data transformation scripts
- [ ] Implement bulk update procedures
- [ ] Add data validation checks
- [ ] Create rollback procedures

### **Step 4.3: Hearing-Committee Relationship Fixes**
- [ ] Parse hearing metadata for committee references
- [ ] Create committee jurisdiction mapping
- [ ] Update hearing records with correct committee IDs
- [ ] Validate relationship integrity

## ✅ **Phase 5: Quality Assurance & Testing**

### **Step 5.1: Data Validation Testing**
- [ ] Verify committee membership accuracy (spot checks)
- [ ] Test hearing-committee relationship queries
- [ ] Validate API endpoint responses
- [ ] Run comprehensive data integrity checks

### **Step 5.2: API Testing**
- [ ] Test member committee queries
- [ ] Test committee member listings
- [ ] Test hearing committee filters
- [ ] Validate pagination and sorting

## 🚀 **Phase 6: Production Deployment**

### **Step 6.1: Staged Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
- [ ] Run full test suite against staging
- [ ] Performance test with corrected data
- [ ] User acceptance testing

### **Step 6.2: Production Release**
- [ ] Create production database backup
- [ ] Execute data corrections in production
- [ ] Validate post-deployment data quality
- [ ] Monitor API performance and accuracy

## 📚 **Phase 7: Documentation & Monitoring**

### **Step 7.1: Documentation Updates**
- [ ] Update API documentation with correct relationships
- [ ] Document data collection procedures
- [ ] Create data quality monitoring procedures
- [ ] Update operational runbooks

### **Step 7.2: Ongoing Monitoring**
- [ ] Implement data quality alerts
- [ ] Schedule regular data validation checks
- [ ] Create committee membership update procedures
- [ ] Monitor for new hearings and committee changes

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Strategy**

### **Tools & Technologies**
- **Data Collection**: Beautiful Soup, Congress.gov API, requests
- **Data Processing**: pandas, sqlalchemy for database operations
- **Validation**: Custom validation scripts, data quality checks
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud SQL, Cloud Run for API updates

### **Expected Outcomes**
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ committee membership accuracy
- **Completeness**: 90%+ hearings properly linked to committees
- **Performance**: No degradation in API response times
- **Reliability**: Automated data quality monitoring

## 📋 **Risk Mitigation**
- **Data Backup**: Full database backup before any changes
- **Rollback Plan**: Script to revert changes if issues occur
- **Staged Testing**: Comprehensive testing in non-production environment
- **Incremental Updates**: Phase corrections to minimize risk

## ⏱️ **Estimated Timeline**
- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 hours (audit and source identification)
- **Phase 3**: 4-6 hours (data collection framework)
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 hours (data correction implementation)
- **Phase 5-6**: 2-3 hours (testing and deployment)
- **Phase 7**: 1-2 hours (documentation and monitoring)

**Total Estimated Time**: 12-18 hours over multiple sessions

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**
1. **Committee Memberships**: Accurate reflection of current 119th Congress committee rosters
2. **Hearing Relationships**: Each hearing properly linked to its conducting committee
3. **API Reliability**: All relationship queries return correct, complete data
4. **Data Quality**: Automated monitoring to prevent future data drift
5. **Documentation**: Complete procedures for ongoing data maintenance
