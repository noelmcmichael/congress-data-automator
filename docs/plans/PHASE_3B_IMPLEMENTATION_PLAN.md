2. **Data Completeness Check**: Identify null values, empty fields, missing data
3. **Data Type Validation**: Verify all data types are correct and consistent
4. **Business Logic Validation**: Check that data makes sense (valid states, parties, dates)
5. **Create Data Quality Report**: Document findings and any data issues

**Expected Outcome**: Complete understanding of data quality and any issues  
**Success Criteria**:

2. **Committee Hierarchies**: Verify parent-child committee relationships
3. **Committee-Hearing Relationships**: Test hearing-committee associations
4. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verify relationship consistency across endpoints
5. **Relationship Performance**: Test performance of complex relationship queries

**Expected Outcome**: All data relationships work correctly with real data  
**Success Criteria**:

### **Step 7: Comprehensive API Endpoint Testing (45 minutes)**
**Objective**: Test all API endpoints systematically with real congressional data

**Actions**:
1. **Member Endpoints Testing**:
   - `/members` - List all members
   - `/members/{id}` - Get member details
   - `/members/{id}/committees` - Member committee assignments
   - `/members/search` - Search members by name, state, party

2. **Committee Endpoints Testing**:
   - `/committees` - List all committees
   - `/committees/{id}` - Get committee details
   - `/committees/{id}/members` - Committee membership
   - `/committees/{id}/hearings` - Committee hearings

3. **Hearing Endpoints Testing**:
   - `/hearings` - List all hearings
   - `/hearings/{id}` - Get hearing details
   - `/hearings/{id}/witnesses` - Hearing witnesses

4. **Search & Filter Testing**:
   - Search by name, state, party, committee
   - Filter by congress, chamber, party
   - Pagination testing with real data

**Expected Outcome**: All endpoints return correct, formatted real data  
**Success Criteria**: 
- [ ] All member endpoints return real congressional data
- [ ] All committee endpoints return real committee data
- [ ] All hearing endpoints work (or return empty if no data)
- [ ] Search and filtering work correctly with real data
- [ ] Pagination works properly with real data volumes

### **Step 8: Error Handling & Edge Cases (30 minutes)**
**Objective**: Test error handling with real-world scenarios

**Actions**:
1. **Invalid ID Testing**: Test with non-existent member/committee IDs
2. **Empty Result Testing**: Test queries that should return empty results
3. **Database Connection Testing**: Simulate database connection issues
4. **Invalid Parameter Testing**: Test with malformed query parameters
5. **Performance Edge Cases**: Test with very large result sets

**Expected Outcome**: Proper error handling for all scenarios  
**Success Criteria**: 
- [ ] Invalid ID requests return proper 404 errors
- [ ] Empty results return proper empty response format
- [ ] Database errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Invalid parameters return proper 400 errors
- [ ] Large result sets are handled properly

### **Step 9: Performance & Scalability Testing (30 minutes)**
**Objective**: Validate performance with real data volumes

**Actions**:
1. **Response Time Testing**: Measure response times for all endpoints
2. **Large Dataset Testing**: Test with maximum page sizes
3. **Complex Query Testing**: Test multi-table joins and complex queries
4. **Concurrent Request Testing**: Test multiple simultaneous requests
