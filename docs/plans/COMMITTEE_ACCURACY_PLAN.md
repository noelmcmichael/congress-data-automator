- [ ] **Assignment Dates**: Term start/end dates for accuracy
- [ ] **Confidence Scoring**: Source reliability indicators

#### **Step 8: Data Replacement Strategy**
- [ ] **Complete Wipe**: Remove all current member-committee relationships
- [ ] **Authoritative Import**: Load verified data from official sources
- [ ] **Relationship Validation**: Ensure referential integrity
- [ ] **Role Assignment**: Properly assign leadership roles

#### **Step 9: Subcommittee Integration**
- [ ] **Subcommittee Structure**: Create proper hierarchical relationships
- [ ] **Member Assignment**: Assign members to appropriate subcommittees
- [ ] **Leadership Mapping**: Subcommittee chairs and ranking members
- [ ] **Cross-Reference**: Ensure consistency with full committee membership

### **PHASE 4: VERIFICATION & TESTING (60 minutes)**

#### **Step 10: Comprehensive Validation**
- [ ] **Test Cases**: Verify all initially identified problem cases
- [ ] **Random Sampling**: Test 50 random member-committee assignments
- [ ] **Leadership Verification**: Confirm all chairs and ranking members
- [ ] **Subcommittee Validation**: Verify subcommittee assignments display correctly

#### **Step 11: UI/Frontend Testing**
- [ ] **Committee Pages**: Verify committee member lists display correctly
- [ ] **Member Profiles**: Confirm member pages show correct committee assignments
- [ ] **Search Function**: Test committee-based search functionality
- [ ] **Filtering**: Verify committee filtering works with accurate data

#### **Step 12: End-to-End Validation**
- [ ] **Database ‚Üí API**: Confirm accurate data flows to API
- [ ] **API ‚Üí Frontend**: Verify frontend displays accurate information
- [ ] **User Scenarios**: Test real-world user workflows
- [ ] **Performance**: Ensure accuracy doesn't impact performance

### **PHASE 5: ONGOING ACCURACY MAINTENANCE (30 minutes)**

#### **Step 13: Monitoring & Alerting**
- [ ] **Change Detection**: Monitor official sources for committee changes
- [ ] **Automated Validation**: Daily accuracy checks against official sources
- [ ] **User Feedback**: System for reporting inaccuracies
- [ ] **Version Control**: Track changes and maintain audit trail

#### **Step 14: Regular Update Procedures**
- [ ] **Monthly Reviews**: Systematic accuracy verification
- [ ] **Congress Transitions**: Procedures for new Congress committee assignments
- [ ] **Mid-session Updates**: Process for resignations, appointments, etc.
- [ ] **Source Reliability**: Monitor and update authoritative sources
